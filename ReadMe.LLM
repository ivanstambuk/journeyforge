# JourneyForge – LLM Guide

Compact orientation for AI coding assistants.

## 1. Scope and Constraints
- Spec‑first API journey orchestrator (YAML/JSON).
- Java 25. HTTP‑centric first; additional connectors later (LDAP/JDBC/Kafka).
- Two façades over time: admin plane and runtime plane; optional UI bridge.

## 2. Modules and Entry Points (initial)
- `journeyforge-runtime-core`: runtime services and execution loop (TBD).
- `journeyforge-connectors-http`: HTTP executor + policies (TBD).
- `app`: temporary CLI runner for local execution (main class `org.example.App` until CLI is scaffolded).

## 3. Development Workflow (SDD)
- Start with a feature spec under `docs/4-architecture/features/<NNN>/spec.md` using templates.
- Track ambiguities in `docs/4-architecture/open-questions.md`.
- Keep increments small; run `spotlessApply check` frequently.

## 4. Useful References
- DSL Reference: `docs/3-reference/dsl.md`
- DSL Style Guide: `docs/4-architecture/spec-guidelines/dsl-style.md`
- Project constitution: `docs/6-decisions/project-constitution.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/4-architecture/roadmap.md`
- Templates: `docs/templates/*`

Expression engines: JourneyForge supports pluggable expression engines selected via `lang` (for example `dataweave`, `jsonata`, `jolt`, `jq`) at DSL expression sites; see ADR‑0027 and Features 012–016.
