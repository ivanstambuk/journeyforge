  :No verification call is made;\nengine waits until timer expiry;
endif

  :Client calls\nGET /journeys/{journeyId}/result;
  :Journeys API returns\nJourneyOutcome with phase/output;
repeat while (phase == "Running") is (still waiting)

if (output.status == "VERIFIED"?) then (verified)
  :Client marks email as verified\nand updates local profile;
