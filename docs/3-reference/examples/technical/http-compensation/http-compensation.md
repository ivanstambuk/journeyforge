# Technical Pattern – Global compensation journey

Status: Draft | Last updated: 2025-11-23

## Problem

Attach a global compensation path that runs when a journey fails, times out, or is cancelled, using `spec.compensation` with access to final context and termination metadata.

## Example – http-compensation

Artifacts for this example:

- Journey: [http-compensation.journey.yaml](http-compensation.journey.yaml)
