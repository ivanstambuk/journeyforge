# Technical Pattern – Request multiplexing & composition

Status: Draft | Last updated: 2025-11-23

## Problem

Call multiple HTTP APIs and combine their responses, including chained calls and conditional composition.

## Example – http-chained-calls

Artifacts for this example:

- Journey: [http-chained-calls.journey.yaml](http-chained-calls.journey.yaml)
- OpenAPI: [http-chained-calls.openapi.yaml](http-chained-calls.openapi.yaml)
- Arazzo: [http-chained-calls.arazzo.yaml](http-chained-calls.arazzo.yaml)
